# Statistics for Environmental Data Science - EDS 222
This repository contains my assignments for [EDS 232 - Machine Learning for Environmental Science](https://tcarleton.github.io/EDS-222-stats/) as part of the [Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS)](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/) program at UCSB.

In this course, among the topics we covered were sampling and study design, OLS, multiple linear regression, interaction models and model fitting, nonlinear relationships, nonlinear regression models, logistic regression, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, time series analysis, spatial interpolation, and Kriging.
Please see my [post](https://andrewbartnik.github.io/Portfolio/stats_final/) for this class's final project
